			'The compiler was developed in C++ using the ANTLR4 framework. It was a team project composed of six members, with responsibilities divided among us. Each member was the designated expert for a specific feature. I was responsible for implementing function-related features, including function definitions, calls, and parameter passing.'

		content: [
			'During this school project, we were tasked with designing and implementing an application from scratch within just two weeks. The only requirement was that the project had to be related to Computer Science.',
			'We chose to develop a social media platform aimed at improving access to nightlife. The goal was to let users see where their friends were going out, share their own experiences, provide live event ratings, receive personalized event recommendations, and access an interactive map to locate nearby events.',
			'The team consisted of eight members, divided into two groups: four focused on the front-end, and four on the back-end. I was part of the back-end team.'

		content: [
			'This school project was our first introduction to full-stack development, and all work was done in pairs. The project was divided into two parts.',
			'The first part involved designing the backend and creating HMI mockups representing the intended front-end. We were responsible for implementing the backend and writing its specifications.',
			'In the second part, we received the backend and specifications developed by another pair, and our task was to implement the front-end based on that backend, using API calls.',
			'The technologies were imposed: a Java backend without any framework, connected to the database using JPA. For the front-end, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Java Servlets.'

			'This project was developed during the Microsoft Intern Hackathon. There were no restrictions on the topic, so our group chose to work on a Machine Learning project for stock market prediction.',
			'The Hackathon lasted four days and emphasized collaboration between Microsoft interns from around the world. We focused on building the ML model and added a simple React front-end to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with it.',
			'The model was designed to predict only the direction of the market. It was based on historical stock data as well as real-time inputs such as news sentiment and market-related feedback.'
